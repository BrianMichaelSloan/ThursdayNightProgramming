# ThursdayNightProgramming

Thursday Projects (TNP) is established for the purpose of developing, honing, and demonstrating proficiency in designing, creating, and implementing software projects with the end-goal of earning employment within the software industry.

TNP will be developed with primary focus on Windows and Android platforms, with an initial focus on design within the Unity framework.  Projects will primarily be 2D, as 2D art assets are simpler to create and obtain, and the current team has a lack of artistic support.  If we were to obtain a graphic designer as a member of our project team, we would develop at least 1 full project within a 3D environment to demonstrate capability & flexibility.

TNP will be a mixture of developing existing games from scratch (classic arcade games, e.g.) and creating new games from existing game paradigms.  Some games will be developed independently and compared, to view different design approaches and their relative effectiveness; some games will be jointly developed, either by developing components as a group, or through a programming-by-contract approach.

TNP will explore Agile and SCRUM developmental approaches in order to obtain working familiarity with industry standards.  TNP will develop professional documentation, practice professional coding practices, and implement project management practices for all major projects in order to better prepare ourselves for working in industry.
